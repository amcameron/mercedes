# node-videotools-cli

Node.js based command line interface to video manipulation tools like mkvtools.
Only intended as a way to start playing with node while doing something marginally useful.

I`ll begin with a utility to merge video and subtitle files into mkv files using mkvmerge

## Installation

This module is installed via npm:

``` bash
$ npm install node-videotools-cli
```

## Example Usage
``` bash
vtools-cli.js -p /Users/Films -v
scans directory tree for video files paired with .srt files and if found packages them in an mkv file. Srt files must be in terminated .lang.srt. As for now it only works with .sp.srt or .es.srt for spanish and .en.srt for english
```

## Todo

1. Basic Tests,
2. Supply encoding and lang via parameters
3. Explore other uses of mkvmerge
4. Explore mkvinfo
5. Perhaps ffmpeg
6. ...
